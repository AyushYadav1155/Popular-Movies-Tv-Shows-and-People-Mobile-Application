## 2.4 How to use it after importing code

To use this application after downloading the source code, you would required to create an API for yourself from TMDB webite.
It is a fairly easy and quick process, for your ease I'm leaving a link to a youtube video that would guide you to perform it.

(P.S : I am from India there is a particular issue I faced that I would other people should avoid, Jio Wifi provider seem to not repond to request sent to TMDB website and one won't be able to use the Website nor the application with that service provider. I would suggest to use mobile data of diffrent company to access the website as well as use the app, this is also for people who live outisde India if the TMDB webite is not responding could be a issue with your ISP and try switching internet to access the website and API)

## 2.5 Libraries used

## 2.6 App Limitations

As I am still a College student in process of learning Advance android development, there are a few Limitations that this application has and in no mean it is a final product. I just want any other developer or viewer to know what this application as of this moment lacks and will be improved in the future.

- The application's update feature only works in 'Light' Mode of the Mobile.

- The update feature can only be used once per app open. (I am assuming it is due to the way I used to call the funtion)

- For some reason sometimes cache momeny isn't updated properly.

If anyone taking an interest in this application and has a idea how to fix them kindly Email me at ayush.rk.yadav14@gmail.com (I have to learn more things in android so I have decided to move on other porjects and work on this while I have free time)

## 2.7 Future Scope

I haven't given much thought on the future of this application but I would like to implement Swipe layout for refreshing and remove the toolbar altogeather to avoid the hassle of fixing toolbar for Day and Night (Light & Dark) Mode.
